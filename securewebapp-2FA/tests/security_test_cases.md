<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
"><script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

admin'/**/OR/**/1=1--
' OR 1=1#
```

### Test Case 7: Input Boundary Testing
**Objective:** Test input length and format validation

**Test Steps:**

   - Empty email: `` (should fail)
   - Invalid format: `notanemail` (should fail)
   - Too long: 300-character email (should fail)
   - Valid email: `user@securebank.com` (should pass)

2. **Password Field Tests:**
   - Too short: `123` (should fail)
